has a significant probability that the user wants to search for. Following this user searches for

Given any url having any image (ofcourse having suitable formats), our bot gives the text in that image.
Interesting huh? This has been possible due to OCR feature of Computer Vision Api.
It is of very great help if you are going through a newspaper for instance, and come across an article which
needs to be looked upon, just click the image and give the public image url to our bot and it will do
the searching for you. Thus saving time to type the whole text for search.
